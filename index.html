        <h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            I just finished my college majoring Finance in India. I plan to start my own start up in Mumbai, India after finishing my summer school.
          </p>
        <h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            I always wanted to learn web development. It will also help me in building web apps for my start up. I will me more independent and won't have to depend on other people for technical needs.
          </p>
        <h2>What previous experience do you have with HTML/CSS?</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            I have very basic HTML and CSS experience. Although I have created a few static web pages, I haven't worked with them extensively. 
          </p>
        <h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            I have taken an online version of the Harvard college CS course CS50. I completed the first 6 weeks of the course. I learnt C language in the course. I have decent programming skills and will be able to learn new things quickly. <br>
            Along with S-15, I am also taking the course S-111 here in summer school. I am learning all the important concepts of programming in that course. 
          </p>
        <h2>Have you worked with PHP before? If so, to what extent?</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            I had started learning PHP on codeacademy. However, I didn't contine it after finishing the first few units. But, the fact that I have learnt programming, I will be able to pick up quickly.
          </p>
        <h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            I am working on a MacBook Pro. OS X Version 10.9.3 </p>
        <h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            I am taking this class as a non-credit course. This is because I wasn't allowed to take more than 8 credits and S-111 is a 8 credit course. <br> 
            However, I will work as hard as I can to complete all the projects in time and attend all the lectures.
